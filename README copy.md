# README
This file is for documentation. 

This is Syed Ali (1799248) and I worked on the creation of PUT and DELETE methods for all tables. First of all I had to make sure all my endpoints for my database are secure. Coding was pretty straight forward and self explanatory. DELETE method selects an id that is provided by the user and then deletes it. PUT method was a little more complicated. I had to assign variables for all table columns and then run the UPDATE command in mysql to update any table. Lastly I tested the api and handled the errors.
